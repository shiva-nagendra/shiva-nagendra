Hi, I'm Shiva

I’m on a 30-week, execution-driven journey to become an AI Engineer, focused on strong fundamentals, disciplined practice, and real-world problem solving. My work emphasizes clean code, logical clarity, and consistent progress.

Current Work

Built and shipped multiple CLI projects:

BMI Calculator

Unit Converter

Number Guessing Game

Hangman

Banking System CLI

Traffic Space Detector CLI

Strengthening problem-solving and structured programming

Preparing for modern AI development (APIs, LLMs, agent-based systems)

Active Repository

AI 30-Week Journey
https://github.com/shiva-nagendra/ai-30week-journey

Daily commits, milestone-based progress, and roadmap-driven execution.

Near-Term Goals

Refine and refactor Phase-1 CLI projects

Deepen Object-Oriented Programming through practical use

Begin API-based application development

Transition into AI-focused projects and agents

"Consistent execution over motivation."

*"Learn, Build, Get Stuck, Fix it, Repeat."*  
I'm focused on executing every single day.
